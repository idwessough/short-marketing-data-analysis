## Data Generation
We need to create a simulated dataset, here's a quick overview  that includes:

1) Sales and User Data

- Game title 
- Purchase date
- Platform: The platform on which the user plays the game (PC, PS5, PS4 or Xbox).
- User ID
- Price
- In-game purchases or DLCs
  
2) Gamer User Behavior Data

- Hours played per game
- Game progression (levels or missions completed out of 100)
- Achievements unlocked (out of 50)
- Multiplayer vs. Single player mode usage (binary: 1 for multiplayer, 0 for single-player) 
- Reason for playing (scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest motivation)
- Expectation score before playing (out of 10)
- Satisfaction score after playing (out of 10)

For simplicity, we'll focus on these small amount of features and generate a dataset for, say, 10,000 users.
